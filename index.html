            I went to the public library and found a book called "Moxie" by Jennifer Mathieu. Moxie is classified as a realistic fiction book for young adults, but older readers like myself have appreciated it as well. The themes of this book include feminism, equality, and justice. The plot is relevant to present global challenges, particularly in the United States, where the effort to remind politicians that women are equal is still ongoing. Similarly, the characters in the novel, particularly the protagonist, are incredibly relatable. Readers see Vivian (the protagonist) grow as a person as the novel continues, from being too timid to speak up, to printing Moxie (a zine she creates to promote feminism) and standing up alongside other "Moxie Girls."

            In compared to previous young adult novels, the author employs an intriguing writing style. This approach is shown by Vivian's conversations with her friends, as well as the strong ties she has with her mother and grandparents. Vivian is a smart character with interesting interior thoughts and conversation. Mathieu also takes a more artistic approach to her writing, designing the pages of each issue of Moxie as Vivian publishes them. Each zine's release is characterized by a change in typeface, accompanied by photographs and other little elements that provide readers with insight into Vivian's inventiveness and a better visual portrayal of the tale.

            Mathieu's realistic work of fiction is an encouraging example of young people discovering their voices and fighting for women's equality and justice. Readers who have battled to come to grips with sexism will identify with Vivian's awareness of its worrying depth. Moxie's power and the events it sparks throughout the novel are testaments to women reclaiming the name feminism, defying the anxieties and judgements connected with it. Mathieu's feminist-driven novel is ideal for teenagers who appreciate compelling coming-of-age stories, especially given its relevance to current women's struggles throughout the world. This work serves as an example and resource for kids who want to speak up for their rights, regardless of the issue. Needless to say, it was a very inspiring book that I read, which helped me to find my voice in situations of injustice.
